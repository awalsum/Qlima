# Qlima-Wifi-Airconditioner
This is a first attempt to create a plugin to control Qlima wifi air conditioners through Domoticz. It is based on a library by NeoArcheron and Mac_Zhou. Clone the repository from Mac_Zhou first ( https://github.com/mac-zhou/midea-msmart.git ) and then add the plugin.py from my repository to it.

Also read how to find your device id. You' ll need it to be able to run the plugin.
